By using Wan2.2 Fun-Control (+Lightning) with First Frame Restyle, it ensures consistent aesthetics, cinematic quality, and stable outputs, giving creators the ability to transform films, anime, and artistic sequences with precision.\n\nWan 2.2 Fun Control lets you generate AI-driven videos with locked first-frame styling, ideal for artists, animators, and filmmakers who want cinematic consistency and creative flexibility. It produces sequences with smooth motions and stable designs, helping you avoid style drift while outputting high-quality, styled video content optimized for storytelling.\n\n## Key Models for Wan 2.2 Fun Control\n### Wan2.2 Fun-Control (+Lightning)\nWan2.2 Fun-Control (+Lightning) is the primary model that powers advanced restyling for video generation. It processes input motion data while enforcing aesthetic stability across frames, making it well-suited for cinematic, anime, or creative transformations. Its integration helps maintain character consistency and elevates artistic video creation.\n\n### First Frame Restyle\nFirst Frame Restyle is essential for anchoring your chosen look at the start of the video. Once a style is applied to the opening frame, that aesthetic carries consistently throughout the entire sequence. This avoids the common issue of style drift in video generation and ensures your vision remains intact across every frame.\n\n## How to Use Wan 2.2 Fun Control\n### Inputs Required\nYou must provide a Video input, which acts as the source material for motion and structure, and supply a Prompt to define the content or styling intentions. Height and Width are also required to set the resolution of the output to match your desired frame size.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can adjust Frames Per Second (FPS) on the Video input to control playback speed. The WanVideo Sampler allows optional tuning with Seed, Steps, and Shift for varied generative outcomes. Additionally, the Video Combine node can specify FPS and choose the Output Format to match playback or sharing needs.\n\n### Outputs\nThe output is a generated video that maintains consistent style and smooth motion throughout. Using the combination of your defined resolution along with controlled frame rate, the result is optimized for cinematic quality. Output is specifically available as video in the selected format, such as h264-mp4.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor best results, use clean and steady Video input sources, as they help Wan 2.2 Fun Control yield more stable styles. Setting Height and Width appropriately ensures output clarity at the desired resolution. Adjusting Frames Per Second in both input and output helps synchronize motion smoothness with creative intent."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
