By integrating models specialized in detection, swapping, and enhancement, you can generate realistic facial replacements with preserved lighting, expressions, and texture. It further supports enhancements like restoration and upscaling to improve output quality.\n\nInsightFace enables seamless face replacement for creators, video editors, and digital artists who want natural, high-quality swaps in their projects. It is designed to efficiently handle both single and multiple face swaps, making it ideal for personalized content creation. With smooth video generation and customizable output, you can achieve professional-looking image or video results effortlessly.\n\n## Key Models for InsightFace\n### Fast Face Swap Node\nThis model is the core of InsightFace functionality, enabling accurate and realistic face swapping. It supports multiple faces in a single image and maintains natural expressions and facial textures. By balancing detection precision, restoration strength, and detail preservation, it delivers flexible outputs suited for both high-quality and faster workflows.\n\n### Face Booster Node\nThe Face Booster model enhances faces after swapping, refining details like visibility and texture. Its role is to restore clarity and maintain a natural look by controlling enhancement intensity and detail preservation. This helps ensure that swapped faces do not appear artificial or over-processed.\n\n### Load Upscale Model Node\nThe Load Upscale Model enables higher resolution outputs by applying AI-based upscaling methods. By boosting resolution, this ensures that final images and videos retain sharpness and clarity. While higher settings may require more resources, the results enhance both image and video realism.\n\n### Video Combine Node\nThe Video Combine model merges processed frames into a cohesive video. It allows users to define playback speed by adjusting frame rate and to generate final video files with specified naming. This ensures smooth and consistent results for outputs whether simple or detailed.\n\n## How to Use InsightFace\n### Inputs Required\nYou need to provide a Video through the Video node if you want to work with moving images, or an Image through the Image node if your project involves still photos. Supplying these inputs ensures the workflow has the source material needed for face swapping and final processing.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can adjust Frames Per Second (FPS) when working with the Video output. This gives you control over the smoothness of video playback. It is optional but useful when balancing between quality presentation and faster processing needs.\n\n### Outputs\nYour final output will be an image or a video with realistic face swaps. With video projects, adjusted frame rate settings allow for smoother or quicker rendering. You can save the processed video or image with enhanced quality and greater realism as supported in the workflow.\n\n### Best Practices\nWhen using the Video input, choose source material with adequate clarity to improve the naturalness of final results. For images, supply high-quality faces for more accurate swaps. Adjusting Frames Per Second (FPS) appropriately helps you maintain smooth motion in video outputs without excessive processing time."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
