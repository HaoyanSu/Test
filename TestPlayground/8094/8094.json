Powered by the FLUX.1 Dev model, the FLUX.1 Dev ControlNet, and the Flux-PuLID Consistent Character model, this tool ensures identity preservation, stability, and reliability across varied poses, expressions, and angles.\n\nFLUX Consistent Character offers creators a way to generate faithful, high-quality character visuals that match reference images or prompts. Designed for artists, filmmakers, and illustrators, it enhances storytelling by maintaining consistency in style and identity. With this tool, you can produce characters that remain stable across multiple outputs, preserving continuity in your creative projects.\n\n## Key Models for FLUX Consistent Character\n### FLUX.1 Dev\nThe FLUX.1 Dev model provides the foundation for stable and reliable generation of consistent characters. It contributes to ensuring that characters retain coherence and identity across different variations. This model is licensed under the [FLUX.1 dev Non-Commercial License](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux/blob/main/model_licenses/LICENSE-FLUX1-dev).\n\n### FLUX.1 Dev ControlNet\nThe FLUX.1 Dev ControlNet enhances control and stability in the workflow, allowing for improved alignment with your specified inputs. It helps ensure that outputs are not only visually reliable but also adaptable to guided changes. This strengthens generative consistency when modifying poses or styles.\n\n### PuLID-Flux | Consistent Character\nThe Flux-PuLID model combines the strengths of PuLID (Pure and Lightning ID Customization) with the FLUX text-to-image system. It excels at maintaining facial identity and character features aligned with an input reference image. More details can be found in the [Flux-PuLID repository](https://github.com/ToTheBeginning/PuLID/tree/main).\n\n## How to Use FLUX Consistent Character\n### Inputs Required\nYou will need to set a **Seed** to initiate controlled randomness in generation. Use the **Prompt** field to describe the character you want. Additionally, define **Width (px)** and **Height (px)** for the image size to suit your output format. These inputs form the foundation for generating consistent characters that resemble your vision.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can adjust the **Strength** setting when applying transformations to balance fidelity and flexibility. Provide an **Image** as a reference when you want variations aligned closely to a specific visual source. For further creative control, the **Guidance Scale** lets you influence how closely the generation follows your prompt, and **Steps** manages the refinement iterations of the character output.\n\n### Outputs\nThe outputs are AI-generated characters that maintain strong visual consistency with the reference image or prompt. You can expect results that capture specific identities, poses, emotions, and backgrounds with high fidelity. Generated outputs will align with the stability and reliability effects described in the Readme.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor best results, use a detailed **Prompt** that specifies the character's defining traits. When including a reference **Image**, ensure it is clear and of good quality, as the Flux-PuLID model performs best with precise visual input. Adjusting **Strength** thoughtfully helps balance accuracy with creative flexibility, while tuning the **Guidance Scale** enhances control over how strictly outputs adhere to your descriptions."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
