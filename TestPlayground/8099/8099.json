This combination ensures natural blending of skin, hair, and expressions, while InsightFace powers precise alignment. It is ideal for creators who value speed, realism, and minimal manual adjustments.\n\nPut It Here Face Swap makes high-quality, photoreal face replacement accessible to artists, designers, and content creators. It lets you input a base image and a source face image, then outputs a refined, context-aware composite with natural textures and expressions. Results are reliable, previewable, and polished, making it perfectly suited for anyone who needs fast, accurate swaps.\n\n## Key Models for Put It Here Face Swap\n### FLUX.1-dev\nFLUX.1-dev is the core diffusion model that drives the image-to-image refinement process. It applies Kontext context conditioning for controlled and consistent results. This model ensures that local areas are regenerated seamlessly while maintaining overall integrity. Learn more at the [official model card](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev).\n\n### FLUX autoencoder (AE)\nThe FLUX autoencoder handles encoding the composite into latent space and decoding generated samples back into pixels. It works as the link between the UNet sampler and the output visuals. The autoencoder ensures smooth translations without distortion. Details can be found at the [FLUX.1-dev model page](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev).\n\n### Text encoders CLIP-L and T5-XXL\nThese encoders add text conditioning support, enabling prompts to guide local face refinement and expression adjustment. CLIP-L and T5-XXL ensure nuanced interpretation of instructions, leading to natural edits that preserve realism. See the original research papers for [CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020) and [T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683).\n\n### InsightFace\nInsightFace powers the face detection and alignment stage of the pipeline. It provides landmark detection for scaling and cropping, ensuring that the inserted face matches angle and proportions correctly. More details can be found on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface).\n\n### Put it here LoRA\nPut it here LoRA specializes in precise localization during regeneration. By guiding the UNet, it ensures that the replaced face sits in exactly the right location without bleeding edits beyond the intended region. This localized influence is critical for maintaining high fidelity in the final swap.\n\n## How to Use Put It Here Face Swap\n### Inputs Required\nYou must provide an Image through the Base Image input and another Image through the Face Image input. These two sources are essential: the base photo contains the subject to modify, and the face image supplies the new facial features. Without both inputs, realistic blending cannot occur.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can adjust the Guidance Scale to control how much the result adheres to the original composition versus the prompt. The Prompt input lets you describe details like expression or hair, refining subtle features of the swap. Using Seed and Steps gives you direct control over generation randomness and iteration depth.\n\n### Outputs\nThe process produces a cleanly swapped image in which the chosen face is seamlessly integrated into the base photo. The output reflects natural skin and hair blending, with local refinements driven by your prompt. Previews and saved images allow you to assess quality and finalize results confidently.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor better results, use a high-quality Base Image with a clearly visible target face and a Face Image under similar lighting. Adjust the Prompt carefully to guide expressions or minor edits without introducing global changes. When needed, tweak the Guidance Scale for stronger adherence to the original composition or more prompt-driven adjustment."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
