It employs the Wan2.2 Fun Inpaint backbone, with the option of Lightning 4-Step LoRA for fast previews, to provide detailed motion, character consistency, and prompt-controlled storytelling for artists, animators, and filmmakers.\n\nWan 2.2 FLF2V is designed for creators who want to turn still images into coherent videos while keeping control over style and narrative with prompts. Using its specialized models, you can generate high-quality sequences that interpolate motion with strong fidelity, delivering consistent visual storytelling from first frame to last.\n\n## Key Models for Wan 2.2 FLF2V\n### Wan 2.2 Fun Inpaint 14B (fp8 scaled)\nThis model is the main diffusion backbone powering the Fun Inpaint video generation process. It is available in high noise and low noise variants, with the high noise version offering bold creative transitions and the low noise version preserving fidelity between frames. Model files are accessible through the [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged).\n\n### Lightning 4-Step LoRA for I2V\nThe Lightning 4-Step LoRA compresses the entire sampling process into only four steps, enabling fast iterations and previews. It is available in both high noise and low noise versions for either bold or more consistent transitions. The LoRA weights can also be found on the [Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged).\n\n### Wan VAE\nThe Wan VAE handles the conversion between latent and pixel spaces, ensuring detail and tonal consistency during the encoding and decoding steps. This component helps maintain visual quality in the rendered sequences. It is part of the [Wan 2.2 package on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged).\n\n### CLIP text encoder\nThe CLIP text encoder maps your positive and negative prompts into conditioning vectors that guide the generation process. This ensures that textual descriptions translate into consistent visual storytelling. The encoder is based on [openai/CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP).\n\n### ComfyUI Video Helper Suite (export)\nThis suite assembles individual frames into a complete MP4 video. It enables you to control frame rate and quality, ensuring output compatibility with common players. Source code is available at the [ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite).\n\n## How to Use Wan 2.2 FLF2V\n### Inputs Required\nYou need to provide a **Start Image** and an **End Image**, which establish the beginning and end of your video. These images serve as anchor points for the interpolation. Additionally, you must add a **Prompt** that defines what should appear and evolve across the sequence, guiding the video content and style.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can adjust the **Width (px)**, **Height (px)**, and **Number of Frames**, which determine the resolution and duration of your video. The **Frames Per Second (FPS)** can also be set, helping to define motion pacing in the exported MP4. These optional inputs allow for customization of size and playback feel.\n\n### Outputs\nThe tool generates a continuous video sequence that connects your start and end images into a smooth transition. Frames are automatically combined into an MP4 file at a default 24 fps, ensuring cinematic playback. You can expect results that retain the creative direction of your prompts with natural, frame-to-frame continuity.\n\n### Best Practices\nMatch the aspect ratio of your **Start Image** and **End Image** to the chosen **Width** and **Height** settings to reduce warping. Keep your **Prompt** concise and focused to guide consistent visual narrative. Adjusting the **Number of Frames** helps control video length, while fine-tuning the **Frames Per Second (FPS)** can optimize pacing for your scene."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
