It delivers video creation up to 20x faster while maintaining cinematic quality. With both text-to-video and image-to-video support, this release makes professional video generation accessible on moderate hardware.\n\nWan 2.2 Lightning is designed to provide creators with rapid, high-quality text-to-video and image-to-video outputs, making it ideal for storytellers, designers, and professionals seeking cinematic visuals quickly. By combining ultra-efficient processing with enhanced OpenAI prompt integration, you can transform ideas into smooth, detailed videos in just moments.\n\n## Key Models for Wan 2.2 Lightning\n### Wan 2.2 Lightning\nWan 2.2 Lightning delivers industry-leading speed in generation, completing video creation in a 4-step process that is 20x faster than traditional methods. It supports both image-to-video and text-to-video workflows while maintaining smooth output quality. The official [Wan 2.2 Lightning LoRA weights](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Wan2.2-Lightning) are available on HuggingFace for direct reference.\n\n### Lightning 4-Step LoRA\nThis 4-step Lightning LoRA model is central to the efficiency of the workflow, allowing rapid video generation without substantial loss in fidelity. It leverages HIGH and LOW noise stages for balanced refinement, ensuring outputs remain cinematic and visually coherent despite the reduced processing steps.\n\n### Lightx2v V2\nLightx2v V2 provides the architectural foundation for improved visuals, offering specialized HIGH and LOW noise models. This dual-model approach ensures both coarse structure and refined detail are handled with precision, making generated videos clearer and more aligned with user prompts.\n\n## How to Use Wan 2.2 Lightning\n### Inputs Required\nYou begin by entering your creative description into the Prompt control, where you can specify detailed narratives or imagery that guide the video generation. Alongside this, you will need to define the Width, Height, and Number of Frames, which set the size and duration of your output video.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nFor finer customization, you can adjust settings such as Seed, Steps, and Shift to influence variation and sampling behavior. Additionally, configure Frames Per Second and Output Format for the final render, ensuring your video meets your playback or publishing needs.\n\n### Outputs\nThe system produces a smooth cinematic video based on your chosen text or image input. By default, resolutions of 832x480 with 81 frames are used, aligning with the workflow design. Your final output is compiled into a playable format, such as h264-mp4, at the frame rate you select.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor best results, craft prompts that include rich motion and scene details to maximize quality. Adjust Steps carefully to balance efficiency and refinement, and use Seed variations to experiment with alternative outputs. Always confirm frame rate and output format settings to match your intended use case."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
