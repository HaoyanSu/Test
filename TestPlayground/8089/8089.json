Powered by the Wan2.2 family of models in ComfyUI, it emphasizes cinematic camera motion without manual keyframes. You gain fast, repeatable results suited for social clips, hero shots, or product animations.\n\nWan 2.2 Fun Camera generates engaging video sequences from one source image, optimized for creators who need speed, consistency, or storytelling energy. It is ideal for artists, content makers, and product showcases, delivering MP4 outputs with clean, cinematic motion while preserving subject clarity.\n\n## Key Models for Wan 2.2 Fun Camera\n### Wan 2.2 Fun Camera 14B high-noise UNet fp8 scaled\nThis model establishes the early structure and motion dynamics from your still image. It drives the first diffusion steps that define global camera movement and motion richness. You can explore details of this model in the [Hugging Face file](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/wan2.2_fun_camera_high_noise_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors).\n\n### Wan 2.2 Fun Camera 14B low-noise UNet fp8 scaled\nThis model refines and stabilizes frames after initial motion has been formed. It enhances details and ensures temporal consistency in the final animated output. More specifics can be found in the [Hugging Face file](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/wan2.2_fun_camera_low_noise_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors).\n\n### Wan2.2 Image-to-Video LightX2V 4 Steps LoRA\nThe LightX2V LoRA variant accelerates the sampling process, offering faster iterations while slightly reducing motion complexity. Both high-noise and low-noise versions are available for flexibility. You can view the [High-noise LoRA](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/loras/wan2.2_i2v_lightx2v_4steps_lora_v1_high_noise.safetensors) and [Low-noise LoRA](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/loras/wan2.2_i2v_lightx2v_4steps_lora_v1_low_noise.safetensors).\n\n### Wan 2.1 VAE\nThis model encodes and decodes latent representations into images throughout the pipeline. It enables the transition from latent diffusion data back to coherent, viewable frames. Learn more from the [Hugging Face file](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/vae/wan_2.1_vae.safetensors).\n\n### UMT5-XXL text encoder fp8\nThe text encoder interprets positive and negative prompts, ensuring that your descriptions influence the generated motion and style. It translates textual intent into conditioning signals used in synthesis. See the [Hugging Face file](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors) for details.\n\n## How to Use Wan 2.2 Fun Camera\n### Inputs Required\nYou must provide an image through the input labeled Image. This serves as the starting point for generating video. Additionally, you need to enter descriptive text in the Prompt input, which guides the subject intent and motion flavor. These are essential for building meaningful animated results.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can adjust Width (px), Height (px), and Number of Frames by configuring these values, which control resolution and length of the output clip. There is also a Shift input available, allowing fine movement adjustment if needed. These settings let you balance output quality, duration, and creative motion.\n\n### Outputs\nThe result will be assembled as an MP4 video file. According to the documentation, the export defaults to a widely compatible H.264 format at a modest frame rate, making it suitable for fast previews and iteration. Your output will preserve the subject while animating the camera path you defined.\n\n### Best Practices\nStart with clear, well-composed images when using the Image input to ensure best animation results. Keep prompts concise and action-oriented when filling in the Prompt input. For longer sequences or different aspect ratios, modify Width (px), Height (px), and Number of Frames carefully to prevent cropping and preserve motion balance."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
