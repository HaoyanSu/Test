Through both text-to-video and image-to-video capabilities, FusionX delivers smoother motion, realistic effects, and enhanced consistency, making it valuable for creators seeking professional video quality without traditional complexity.\n\nFusionX gives you full creative control for generating high-quality videos from descriptive text or reference images. Whether you are a content creator, researcher, or hobbyist, it helps you produce visually compelling results that stay true to your prompts while streamlining the entire video creation process.\n\n## Key Models for FusionX\n### CausVid\nCausVid provides causal motion modeling that enhances scene flow and significantly improves speed. Integrated into Wan FusionX, it allows the generation of videos with smoother transitions and dynamic movements that feel more natural within cinematic storytelling.\n\n### AccVideo\nAccVideo contributes enhanced temporal alignment and realism. Its integration into Wan FusionX ensures faster generation while preserving video consistency, making it especially helpful for maintaining continuity across frames.\n\n### MoviiGen1.1\nMoviiGen1.1 is tailored for cinema-quality smoothness and lighting. Its role in Wan FusionX emphasizes delivering visually rich, stylistic depth across different scenes, creating results that feel immersive and professional-grade.\n\n### MPS Reward LoRA\nThe MPS Reward LoRA is optimized for improving motion dynamics and fine details. Within Wan FusionX, it ensures that generated content balances fluid motion with texture clarity, enriching the overall fidelity of the videos.\n\n### Custom LoRAs\nCustom LoRAs allow flexible optimization for detail enhancement. They make Wan FusionX versatile across use cases, supporting different artistic styles and fine-tuning results for creators who require more specific visual adjustments.\n\n## How to Use FusionX\n### Inputs Required\nYou will need to define a descriptive text in the Prompt field, along with generation settings such as Seed, Steps, and Shift. These determine the creative direction of your video and the consistency of outputs. For image-to-video tasks, you can supply a reference image as the base to guide the animation.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou may choose to adjust Width, Height, or Number of Frames for more control over resolution and sequence length. You can also set the Output Format and Frames Per Second to determine the playback style. These options let you modify how your final video is structured while retaining core FusionX quality.\n\n### Outputs\nThe system produces a completed video in your specified format, such as h264-mp4. With recommended settings, you can generate up to 121 frames at 24 frames per second, giving you smooth cinematic output aligned with your initial prompt or input image.\n\n### Best Practices\nKeep Steps in the range of 6 to 10 and CFG at 1.0 for optimal results, as advised in the FusionX documentation. Use Shift values carefully to balance realism and artistic style. For smoother motion, set your Frames Per Second around 24, and always refine prompts with clear descriptions for stronger alignment."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
