You gain professional-quality results in just 8-14 steps, with up to 4x faster speed than standard workflows, while maintaining excellent detail, motion coherence, and visual quality.\n\nWan 2.2 LightX2V gives you a turbocharged video generation solution designed for creators, professionals, and innovators who value both speed and quality. It produces short, cinematic clips from either text or image inputs, making it ideal for rapid prototyping, storytelling, and polished content creation.\n\n## Key Models for Wan 2.2 LightX2V\n### Wan 2.2\nWan 2.2 is a foundation model developed by Alibaba, optimized for high-quality video generation with strong motion coherence and visual fidelity. It supports text-to-video and image-to-video tasks, and through its two-stage sampling approach enables detailed and professional outputs. You can explore pre-trained Wan 2.2 model weights on the [HuggingFace Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged).\n\n### Lightx2v V2 LoRA\nLightx2v V2 serves as a distillation LoRA designed to accelerate Wan 2.2 generation dramatically. By reducing the typical 40 steps of the two-stage process down to just 8-14 steps, it enables lightning-fast output while retaining quality. Its strength lies in making powerful video generation more accessible with lower hardware requirements. Distilled LoRA files are available in the [Lightx2v Collection](https://huggingface.co/lightx2v).\n\n## How to Use Wan 2.2 LightX2V\n### Inputs Required\nTo begin, you need to provide video dimensions with Width (px), Height (px), and Number of Frames to define the structure of your output. You must also enter a Prompt, which describes the content, mood, and style you want the Wan 2.2 LightX2V system to generate. These ensure your output has both correct format and desired content.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can refine your results by setting Steps and Seed within the sampler inputs. Adjusting these lets you balance generation speed with quality, while also controlling reproducibility through the seed value. You may also choose to load an Image as a starting point when using image-to-video generation.\n\n### Outputs\nYou receive a professional-quality video clip aligned with your chosen dimensions and frame count. The system is optimized for generating outputs such as 704 by 544 videos at 81 frames, which equates to approximately 3.4 seconds at 24fps. The result will reflect both your prompt and any chosen image input.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor best results, craft your Prompt with clear details about visuals, motion, and mood. Use consistent Steps values to maintain a smooth handoff between different stages of generation. Select a Seed to ensure repeatability, and provide a carefully chosen Image if you want to anchor video creation to a specific frame."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
