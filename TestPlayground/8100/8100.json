Built on FLUX.1 Kontext Dev (+Place It Here LoRA), it supports natural lighting, shadows, and perspective, producing quality results for professional compositing, e-commerce, and product visualization where realism is essential.\n\nPut It Here Kontext brings you an AI-powered assistant for seamless compositing. It is perfect for creatives, product photographers, and designers who need realistic object insertion. With clear prompts and intelligent placement, Put It Here Kontext generates studio-quality outputs by ensuring objects blend naturally into their new environment.\n\n## Key Models for Put It Here Kontext\n### FLUX.1 Kontext Dev\nThe FLUX.1 Kontext Dev model enables advanced contextual object insertion by analyzing spatial relationships, lighting, and environmental cues. It powers the placement process by understanding depth and perspective, ensuring that inserted objects look natural within their background. This makes it ideal for scenarios where realism is a top priority.\n\n### Place It Here LoRA\nThe Place It Here LoRA is an enhancement model designed to refine contextual alignment and object blending. It contributes precise placement adjustments, allowing the workflow to integrate objects seamlessly into different environments. When paired with FLUX.1 Kontext Dev, it ensures the resulting images achieve a polished, professional finish.\n\n## How to Use Put It Here Kontext\n### Inputs Required\nTo begin, you must provide an Image input using the image upload option. Additionally, enter your creative instruction in the Prompt input, describing how the object should appear in the scene. These inputs drive the placement process by defining both the visual starting point and your intent.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can refine results further with the Seed input, available in tools like FastCanvas, Image Cropper, or during sampling. Adjusting the Steps value enables you to control how many refinement passes are applied. These optional settings provide flexibility and variation without changing the core inputs.\n\n### Outputs\nThe outputs are high-quality, realistic composites where objects on white backgrounds are seamlessly integrated into the target scene. With proper object preparation, Put It Here Kontext delivers professional-grade images that maintain natural lighting, shadows, and consistency for your desired applications.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor best results, keep your prompts descriptive yet simple in the Prompt input, ensuring clarity about how the object should appear. Use quality source images through the Image input to maintain fidelity when blending. Experiment with different Seed values to explore creative variations while locking in settings that produce your desired result."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
