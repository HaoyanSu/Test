Powered by FLUX.1 Fill Dev and the ACE++ Portrait LoRA, it produces seamless results that preserve the original style and details while ensuring natural blending.\n\nACE++ Face Swap brings you an easy way to swap faces in images with precision and consistency. Whether you are an artist, storyteller, or simply exploring creative experiments, it enables high-quality outputs saved to your system without requiring advanced editing skills.\n\n## Key Models for ACE++ Face Swap\n### Portrait LoRA Model\nThe Portrait LoRA Model is designed to enhance portrait-focused outputs by helping the workflow maintain visual fidelity and detail when applying face swaps. It ensures the swapped faces align naturally with the original style of the image. You can find it available for download [here](https://huggingface.co/ali-vilab/ACE_Plus/tree/main/portrait).\n\n### Flux Fill FP8 Model\nThe Flux Fill FP8 Model provides context-aware content filling, which is essential for completing image areas smoothly after a face has been swapped. By restoring missing or masked regions, it ensures seamless integration of the new face. This model is accessible [here](https://civitai.com/models/969431/flux-fill-fp8).\n\n### Flux Turbo LoRA\nFlux Turbo LoRA accelerates image generation and supports consistency across outputs when experimenting with face swaps. It contributes to balancing speed with quality, enabling more efficient generation without sacrificing natural-looking details. Find it [here](https://civitai.com/models/876388/flux1-turbo-alpha).\n\n## How to Use ACE++ Face Swap\n### Inputs Required\nTo start, you need to provide an Image where the face swap will occur and a secondary Image that contains the new face. These two inputs are essential for defining both the context image and the replacement face that ACE++ Face Swap will blend together.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can refine your outputs with several optional controls. A Prompt text input allows you to guide the generation with descriptions. The Guidance Scale adjusts how strongly the system responds to your prompt. You can also modify settings such as Seed and Steps to influence randomness and quality, or specify custom Width and Height for resizing.\n\n### Outputs\nThe results of your generated images will be automatically saved into the Output > AceFaceSwap folder within ComfyUI. The outputs preserve the original image style and integrate the new face naturally, providing high-quality face-swapped images for creative or professional use.\n\n### Best Practices\nWhen setting up your session, keeping the Guidance Scale high helps ensure more accurate prompt responses. Using around 10-12 Steps provides a good balance of quality and speed. For optimal face-swap results, make sure your source and replacement Images are clear and well-framed."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
