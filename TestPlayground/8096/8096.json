Powered by FLUX.1 Fill Dev and the ACE++ Portrait LoRA model, it ensures reliable, high-quality outputs, perfect for illustrations, comics, animations, and AI-driven storytelling projects.\n\nACE++ Consistent Character streamlines your creative workflow by keeping character features stable while letting you adapt them with descriptive prompts. It is designed for creators of animations, comics, and illustrated narratives who need coherent characters across multiple images. The outputs retain fidelity to the reference style while ensuring consistency in appearance.\n\n## Key Models for ACE++ Consistent Character\n### Portrait Lora Model\nThe Portrait Lora Model enhances character consistency by aligning generated outputs with the reference facial features and style. This model is essential for maintaining a uniform look across different renderings. It can be downloaded as [comfyui_portrait_lora64.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/ali-vilab/ACE_Plus/tree/main/portrait) for use within the workflow.\n\n### Flux Fill FP8 Model\nThe Flux Fill FP8 Model provides robust content filling that preserves the original style while adapting to new prompts and poses. By integrating with ACE++, it ensures coherent visual results across images, making it ideal for animation frames or series panels. This model can be obtained from [Flux Fill FP8](https://civitai.com/models/969431/flux-fill-fp8).\n\n## How to Use ACE++ Consistent Character\n### Inputs Required\nYou begin by providing your reference through the Image input. This is the foundation of maintaining consistency because the uploaded image dictates the style and character features in your generated outputs. Ensuring a proper starting point allows ACE++ to reproduce coherent looks in all results.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can refine your results through Prompt, which lets you describe the scene or style adjustments you want. Seed provides control over reproducibility and variation, while Steps define how many refinement passes will occur. Guidance Scale allows you to strengthen coherence, and Width (px) and Height (px) can ensure the image is resized to optimal 1024x1024 resolution when needed.\n\n### Outputs\nYour generated character images will be saved automatically in the Outputs folder. These images retain the style and character features of your reference while adapting to your described prompts. The Readme specifies that images at 1024x1024 resolution yield the best consistency and manageability.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor the most reliable results, use a clear and centered Image that will be resized to 1024x1024, ensuring optimal consistency. Writing descriptive content in the Prompt helps steer the generation toward your desired outcome. Keeping the Guidance Scale high enhances fidelity, while maintaining consistent Steps and Seed settings improves controllability across multiple generations."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
