It enhances images from 4k up to 32k resolution, delivering fine details and artifact-free clarity for professionals needing pristine outputs across a range of use cases.\n\nFlux Upscaler is your solution for scaling visuals to cinematic-quality clarity, whether you are a designer, artist, or content creator. By offering crisp details up to 32k resolution, it ensures flexibility across photorealistic and artistic styles. This makes Flux Upscaler ideal when precision, adaptability, and stunning results are required for high-end visual projects.\n\n## Key Models for Flux Upscaler\n### FLUX Realistic SaMay V2 (ckpt based on FLUX.1 Dev)\nThis model drives the upscaler with a base rooted in the FLUX.1 Dev checkpoint, optimized for realistic rendering. By maintaining intricate details and enhancing visual fidelity, it provides a core foundation that ensures images scale well across multiple resolutions. It adapts easily across styles such as realistic, anime, or artistic projects.\n\n### Flux.1 Dev Controlnet Upscaler\nThe [Flux.1 Dev Controlnet Upscaler](https://huggingface.co/jasperai/Flux.1-dev-Controlnet-Upscaler/tree/main) acts as a specialized tile controlnet. It refines edges, enhances consistency, and reduces seam artifacts during large-scale upscaling. By integrating strength and percent-based controls, it strengthens the smoothness and accuracy of outputs at ultra-high resolutions.\n\n## How to Use Flux Upscaler\n### Inputs Required\nTo start, you need to provide an Image, which serves as the basis for upscaling. This initial input ensures that Flux Upscaler has visual material to process. You will also set parameters like Seed and Steps, which guide the consistency and progression of your upscale process.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can optionally adjust Guidance Scale to influence how strongly the system adheres to refined detail and style. Additionally, using Strength with an Image in certain processes allows you to balance detail sharpness against potential artifacts, tailoring the results to your preferred visual outcome.\n\n### Outputs\nFlux Upscaler produces upscaled images that retain accuracy across resolutions ranging from 4k to 32k. The results are clean, artifact-free, and maintain the original image integrity. You can expect sharpness and detail improvements while aligning with the artistic or realistic qualities defined by your inputs.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor best results, use reasonable values for Strength to avoid losing fine details, and adjust the Seed and Steps thoughtfully to manage both creativity and consistency. Keeping Guidance Scale balanced ensures enhanced control without introducing artifacts. These practices help achieve smooth, high-quality upscale outputs."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
