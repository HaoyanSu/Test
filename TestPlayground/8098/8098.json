It enables creators to achieve high-fidelity results where facial features remain consistent across different poses, scenes, and styles, while still providing creative flexibility.\n\nFLUX Kontext Face Swap delivers reliable face-swapping and identity preservation for artists, designers, and content creators. By guiding generations with a single reference image, it produces consistent, high-quality portraits or stylized renders. Ideal for exploring character stability and creative versatility, its outputs maintain strong realism and expressive detail.\n\n## Key Models for FLUX Kontext Face Swap\n### FLUX.1 Kontext Dev (+Canopus-LoRA-Flux-UltraRealism-2.0 LoRA)\nThis model forms the foundation of the FLUX Kontext Face Swap workflow. Built on the FLUX Diffusion Transformer and enhanced with LoRA for ultra-realism, it delivers high-fidelity results across various artistic styles. It provides expressive, detailed images where creative prompts align closely with visual output.\n\n### PuLID | Face Swap\nPuLID is responsible for identity control within FLUX Kontext Face Swap. By encoding facial details from a reference image, it ensures identities remain intact even when applying different prompts or artistic variations. Its weight and timeline control make it possible to balance between realism and stylistic flexibility without losing character consistency.\n\n## How to Use FLUX Kontext Face Swap\n### Inputs Required\nYou need to upload an image using the Image input, which provides the essential face reference for identity preservation. You should also enter a Prompt that describes the desired scene, pose, or style. Together, these inputs guide the generation process and ensure both identity accuracy and expressive creativity.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can refine your outputs using the Guidance Scale to adjust how strongly prompts shape the result. To influence reproducibility, set a Seed value. You may also modify Steps to affect the sampling depth and use Width (px) and Height (px) to adjust the image size. These optional controls let you fine-tune quality, variability, and resolution.\n\n### Outputs\nThe generated images maintain the face identity of your chosen reference while adapting to the descriptive context in your prompts. Results are enhanced with realism or stylistic variations based on your inputs. Final outputs are saved automatically to the designated output folder in ComfyUI, making them easy to locate and use.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor strong identity preservation, always begin with a clear and high-quality face in the Image input. Use descriptive language in your Prompt to get expressive yet consistent results. Adjust the Guidance Scale modestly to balance between staying close to your vision and allowing creative variation. Experiment with Steps and resolution settings to find the best trade-off between speed and image detail."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
