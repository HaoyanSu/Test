Using the Wan2.2 VACE Fun A14B model as its foundation, it balances subject consistency, expressive motion, and visual fidelity, making it ideal for creative prototyping and storytelling.\n\nWan2.2 VACE enables you to animate a reference image with prompts, producing short videos that preserve identity and style. It is designed for artists, creators, and developers who need cinematic iteration, character animation, or quick visualization. You provide the inputs, and it delivers expressive MP4 sequences ready for review or sharing.\n\n## Key Models for Wan2.2 VACE\n### Alibaba PAI Wan 2.2 VACE Fun A14B\nThis model is the core of the workflow, transforming your reference image and prompts into a video-ready latent sequence. It prioritizes subject-driven animation and identity preservation. You can explore details in its [model card](https://huggingface.co/alibaba-pai/Wan2.2-VACE-Fun-A14B).\n\n### Wan 2.2 Text-to-Video A14B (HIGH/LOW)\nThe text-to-video models provide staged denoising for optimal trade-offs between speed and detail. The HIGH variant emphasizes nuanced textures and fidelity, while the LOW variant focuses on motion stability. Both are available as packaged weights at [Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged).\n\n### UMT5-XXL text encoder\nAs a multilingual text encoder, UMT5-XXL powers prompt understanding in Wan2.x. It allows rich expressive prompting in both English and Chinese. Repackaged encoders compatible with this workflow can be found at [Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged).\n\n### Wan 2.1 VAE\nThis model decodes the video latents generated by the system into RGB image frames. It ensures the output frames can be seamlessly assembled into videos. The VAE is provided as part of the [Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.2_ComfyUI_Repackaged) resources.\n\n## How to Use Wan2.2 VACE\n### Inputs Required\nYou begin by setting values for Height (px), Width (px), Number of Frames, and Frames Per Second (FPS). These ensure the resolution, length, and playback smoothness of your output video. You must also provide a Prompt to direct motion and artistic intent and load an Image as the subject reference.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nAdditional flexibility comes from using Sampling Steps to fine-tune detail and stability, and adjusting Shift to nudge balance between motion and texture. The Seed can be set for reproducibility or varied for alternative versions. These parameters let you optimize results without changing your core inputs.\n\n### Outputs\nThe workflow produces an MP4 video as output. The generated clip length is determined by the Number of Frames and Frames Per Second, while resolution follows your Height and Width values. The result is an expressive animated sequence consistent with your subject and guided by your prompt.\n\n### Best Practices\nMatch your reference Image aspect ratio to the Height and Width inputs to avoid stretching and cropping. Use clear and action-oriented words in the Prompt to get expressive motion. Adjust Frames Per Second to control pacing, and reuse the same Seed to reliably compare iterations."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
