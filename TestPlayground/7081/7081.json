The system preserves identity while enabling expressive facial detail, producing emotion-rich video clips tailored for creators seeking cinematic motion from a single portrait.\n\nFantasy Portrait helps you turn still images into dynamic, identity-preserving animations. Ideal for creators, artists, and storytellers, it generates expressive video clips with natural movement from a portrait photo. The output is a high-fidelity MP4 video with consistent framing and polished cinematic quality.\n\n## Key Models for Fantasy Portrait\n### FantasyPortrait (Fantasy-AMAP)\nThe FantasyPortrait model provides core identity and expression-aware embeddings, ensuring subject traits are preserved while allowing nuanced facial motion. It is the heart of the Fantasy Portrait workflow. You can learn more through the [GitHub project](https://github.com/Fantasy-AMAP/fantasy-portrait) and the corresponding [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12956).\n\n### WanVideo 2.1 I2V (14B, 720p)\nWanVideo 2.1 acts as the video diffusion backbone, enabling high-resolution animation generation from portrait and prompt guidance. It samples video content using both image and text conditions, producing consistent and expressive results. Quantized and Comfy-ready weights are available via [Kijai's Hugging Face model pack](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy).\n\n### UMT5-XXL encoder\nThe UMT5-XXL encoder provides strong text encoding capabilities for guiding the generated video with positive and negative prompts. This ensures that descriptive directions for mood or style influence the Fantasy Portrait output effectively. Example weights, such as `umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.safetensors`, can be found in [Kijai's model repository](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy/blob/main/umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.safetensors).\n\n### Wan 2.1 VAE\nThe Wan 2.1 VAE is optimized for encoding and decoding video latents, turning generated frames into final images with efficient fidelity. It ensures the Fantasy Portrait animations retain high visual quality during compression and reconstruction. Example weights like `Wan2_1_VAE_bf16.safetensors` are available through [Kijai's pack](https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo_comfy).\n\n## How to Use Fantasy Portrait\n### Inputs Required\nYou must begin by providing an image through the Image input, which serves as the foundation of the Fantasy Portrait generation. Define the Width and Height values to set your output dimensions, and use Number of Frames to control how long your animated portrait will run. These inputs are essential to ensure framing consistency and proper animation length.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou can guide the artistic or emotional quality of the output by adding a Prompt with short descriptive phrases. If desired, you may adjust Seed to vary randomness between generations, Shift to influence motion timing, and Steps to refine sampling precision. These optional controls let you experiment with stylistic variation while keeping subject identity preserved.\n\n### Outputs\nThe workflow produces a high-quality MP4 video, defaulting to 16 fps and yuv420p format, based on the Readme description. This output is constructed from your source portrait, combined with embeddings and prompts, to generate cinematic and expression-rich motion. The result is a polished Fantasy Portrait animation clip.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor the best outcomes, use a clean, well-lit portrait image as your starting input. Keep your Prompt concise and focused on mood or lighting rather than identity details. Moderate adjustments to Steps can sharpen visuals, while concise prompts ensure that expressions remain natural. Always verify that Width, Height, and Number of Frames match your intended framing and duration."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
