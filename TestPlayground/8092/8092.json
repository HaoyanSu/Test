With its automatic model setup and optimized performance, you can focus on crafting expressive prompts and enjoy consistently professional outputs.\n\n## Key Models for Instagirl LoRA\n### Instagirl Wan 2.2\nThe Instagirl Wan 2.2 LoRA is pre-integrated and optimized for seamless portrait generation. It automatically enhances facial features and styling in portrait prompts while maintaining character consistency. This specialized LoRA eliminates manual adjustments while ensuring polished, high-quality results. More information is available on the [Instagirl Wan 2.2 model card](https://civitai.com/models/1822984/instagirl-wan-22).\n\n### Wan 2.2\nThe Wan 2.2 foundation model provides the advanced diffusion architecture that powers Instagirl LoRA generations. It ensures exceptional image fidelity and preserves the intended style of each portrait prompt. By integrating with Instagirl Wan 2.2, it delivers a cinematic effect with stable and high-resolution results.\n\n## How to Use Instagirl LoRA\n### Inputs Required\nTo begin generating, you must supply a description in the Prompt field. This positive prompt guides the portrait composition and overall details. Width and Height inputs are required to set the dimensions of the output, ensuring that the image is generated at the size you prefer.\n\n### Optional Inputs and Controls\nYou may set a Seed to control randomness in the output. This helps reproduce results or explore variations. The Steps value can also be adjusted to balance speed versus fidelity, providing flexibility depending on whether you want faster results or higher image quality.\n\n### Outputs\nThe output consists of high-fidelity portraits generated to match your prompt and chosen dimensions. These images reflect the cinematic and Instagram-ready aesthetic described in the Readme. By default, outputs are automatically saved in your ComfyUI outputs directory for easy access and further use.\n\n### Best Practices\nFor optimal results, write clear portrait-focused prompts, describing both subject and lighting as suggested. Keeping batch size at 1 delivers the best quality, and adjusting Steps allows you to control quality versus speed. Using a consistent Seed can help you refine and replicate specific outputs reliably."},{"section_type":"IO","items":[]},{"section_type":"related-playgrounds","title":"Related Playgrounds","items":[]}]]}
