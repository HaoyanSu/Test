Detailed Introduction

This workflow allows you to use the Flux Kontext model to edit your image. I have put a dozen lora, mainly style editing ones.

Example for changing hair colors :




Workflow presentation :

The workflow uses the Kontext Dev Model, you can upload different version like the FP8 directly into the diffusion_models folder by uploading the link from Hugginface.




Upload the images.




Write your prompt, you can also add loras with the Power Lora Loader node, exampe of included loras down below.

Initially the workflow resize the image to dimensions preferred by the model and if you use 2 images, it stiches them together and uses the size of the stiched images for the output, I put the get image size node with an empty latent image to take only the dimensions of the first image.

You can go back to let the workflow choose the Kontext preferred dimensions by replacing the link from the empty latent to from the VAE encode latent output to the latent_image of the ksampler.

You can also remove the link from the get image size Â to the empty latent and put custom dimensions, although it messes with the output quality.







You're now ready to get to it !

Here are the example for the loras included in the workflow, you can add lora by uploading them in the lora folder, I also put a note node with the file name to load in the lora node and the prompt to use :

Kontext_change_clothes : didn't try putting a shirt on the cat.

UnFlux : didn't try it but it's supposed to help remove the flux style of flux generated images.

Fluffy Kontext Dev LoRA : the cat is already fluffy so it didn't show much changes :)
