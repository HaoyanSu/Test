Q:
What are the key features of Google Veo 3's video generation?
A:
1. Native Audio Generation: The Google Veo 3 produces synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and music directly from the prompt, eliminating the need for manual sound editing.  
2. Enhanced Visual Realism: Google Veo's third-generation AI delivers rich textures, detailed lighting, and lifelike motion for cinematic-quality results.  
3. Advanced Physics Simulation: This AI innovation models real-world physics—fabric motion, human gestures, object interactions—with fluid and natural movement.  
4. Cinematic Language Understanding: Google Veo 3's supports directorial terms like "timelapse" or "over-the-shoulder shot," translating them into precise camera behavior.  
5. Character Consistency: The Google Veo 3 maintains appearance, clothing, and visual continuity of characters across multiple clips.  
6. High-Resolution Output: Google Veo 3 AI model supports HD and up to 4K-level rendering, ideal for professional-grade content creation. For earlier-generation AI capabilities, check out Veo 2 on RunComfy (https://www.runcomfy.com/playground/google-deepmind/veo-2).
