Cosmos Predict2 Video2World ComfyUI Official Example

This guide demonstrates how to complete Cosmos-Predict2 Video2World workflows in ComfyUI

Cosmos-Predict2 is NVIDIAâ€™s next-generation physical world foundation model, specifically designed for high-quality visual generation and prediction tasks in physical AI scenarios. The model features exceptional physical accuracy, environmental interactivity, and detail reproduction capabilities, enabling realistic simulation of complex physical phenomena and dynamic scenes.

Cosmos-Predict2 supports various generation methods including Text-to-Image (Text2Image) and Video-to-World (Video2World), and is widely used in industrial simulation, autonomous driving, urban planning, scientific research, and other fields. It serves as a crucial foundational tool for promoting deep integration of intelligent vision and the physical world.

This guide will walk you through completing Video2World generation in ComfyUI.

For the text-to-image section, please refer to the following part:

Using Cosmos-Predict2 for text-to-image generation

If you find missing nodes when loading the workflow file below, it may be due to the following situations:

You are not using the latest Development (Nightly) version of ComfyUI.
You are using the Stable (Release) version or Desktop version of ComfyUI (which does not include the latest feature updates).
You are using the latest Commit version of ComfyUI, but some nodes failed to import during startup.

Please make sure you have successfully updated ComfyUI to the latest Development (Nightly) version. See: How to Update ComfyUI section to learn how to update ComfyUI.

3. Complete Workflow  Step by Step

Please follow the steps in the image to run the workflow:

Ensure the Load Diffusion Model node has loaded cosmos_predict2_2B_video2world_480p_16fps.safetensors
Ensure the Load CLIP node has loaded oldt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors
Ensure the Load VAE node has loaded wan_2.1_vae.safetensors
Upload the provided input image in the Load Image node
(Optional) If you need first and last frame control, use the shortcut Ctrl(cmd) + B to enable last frame input
(Optional) You can modify the prompts in the ClipTextEncode node
(Optional) Modify the size and frame count in the CosmosPredict2ImageToVideoLatent node
Click the Run button or use the shortcut Ctrl(cmd) + Enter to run the workflow
Once generation is complete, the video will automatically save to the ComfyUI/output/ directory, you can also preview it in the save video node
