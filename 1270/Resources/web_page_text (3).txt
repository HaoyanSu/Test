Creating a custom workflow can be powerful â€” but also a bit tricky, especially when working with ComfyUI and advanced AI models. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve opened this thread, not just to provide guides and resources, but to give everyone a space to exchange knowledge, share experiences, and help each other grow stronger together.

This thread is for:

 Learning how to build and modify your own custom workflows
 Downloading and installing Reallusionâ€™s custom nodes
 Discussing advanced setups, cloud rendering, and AI models
 Sharing your own workflows and seeing how others build theirs

When sharing your workflows, please include Hugging Face links or sources for the models you used. This helps others test, learn, and improve more easily.

If youâ€™ve created a custom setup, made tweaks to the pipeline, or integrated high-end models â€” weâ€™d love to see it!

 Step-by-Step Guide + Sample Workflow

Want to learn how to build and reuse your custom workflows?
 Check out our step-by-step guide â€” it walks you through:

How Reallusion nodes interact with the UI in Character Creator and iClone

How to save your custom workflows as AI Render presets

How to reuse your favorite setups instantly inside the app

Weâ€™ve also included a Flux image-to-image sample workflow to help you get started quickly â€” you can use it as-is or modify it for your own projects.

 Where to Get the AI Render Custom Nodes

If youâ€™re already working in ComfyUI and want to integrate AI Render into your workflow, youâ€™ll need to install Reallusionâ€™s custom nodes:

Where to Get Custom Nodes:

 Local path (if you have iClone 8 installed):
C:\Program Files\Reallusion\iClone 8\AIRender\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-Reallusion

 GitHub (latest version):
https://github.com/reallusion/ComfyUI-Reallusion

How to Install:

Copy the contents into your ComfyUI folder here:
ComfyUI\custom_nodes

 More Help Coming Soon

This is just the beginning â€” we know building custom workflows takes time and practice. To support you further, weâ€™re planning a series of webinars and in-depth tutorials to walk through advanced setups, cloud integration, and best practices. Weâ€™ll release them as soon as theyâ€™re ready â€” stay tuned!

I agree, but it will require some studying on my part to understand it all. I have done hardly anything with various AI models and my brain is quite old.

Yaâ€¦itâ€™s going to take some tinkering to get this going - I think a basic understanding of comfy is essential to get this up and running. Hope someone puts out some videos on how to make and run custom workflows so that noobs like me can follow it to the T, lol
