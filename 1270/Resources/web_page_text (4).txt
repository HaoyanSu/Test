Discover how AI is used to reimagine 3D visuals, and how you can win a FREE CC5!

We’re excited to launch the Open Beta of AI Render plugin, a powerful and completely free tool that bridges real-time 3D animation with AI-powered rendering, seamlessly integrated into the ComfyUI workflow.

Whether you want to explore creative, stylized AI generations or need consistent, frame-accurate results for production, AI Render is built to deliver both. It’s a flexible, scalable solution designed to meet the full range of creator needs — from fast, artistic exploration to precise, professional fine-grain control.

ComfyUI + Reallusion = Speed, Accessibility, and Ease

The ComfyUI workflow is a powerhouse in the AI art community, known for its flexible, node-based system that supports ControlNet, LoRA, and fully customizable pipelines. Combined with Reallusion’s fast, beginner-friendly tools like Character Creator and iClone — which offer intuitive slider-based design, drag-and-drop assets, and real-time scene editing. To make this integration possible, AI Render uses custom nodes that connect Reallusion’s 3D environments directly into the ComfyUI ecosystem.

For Reallusion users, AI Render works seamlessly within familiar tools — no ComfyUI experience needed. For ComfyUI users, it enables precise 3D-guided generation and full freedom to build custom workflows with added control and consistency.

22 Style Presets, Endless Possibilities

AI Render includes 22 professionally tuned style presets across three types: Realistic, 3D, and 2D.

It offers 11 AI Image Generation models for still renders and 11 AI Video Generation models optimized for consistent frame-by-frame results, giving you a quick, creative head start for both image and video projects.

By default, AI Render runs locally using Stable Diffusion 1.5, Wan2.1 Fun 1.3B Control, and Wan2.1 VACE 1.3B models, which are optimized for quality and performance on accessible hardware.

For users seeking more advanced or cinematic results, AI Render also supports third-party high-end models such as Flux, HiDream, and FusionX. These require significantly more GPU power or access to a cloud GPU platform like RunPod or RunComfy. More details are available on the [official forum].

Prompt to Precision: Fine-Tune AI Gen with Text 

You can further customize your results using text prompts, which offer more detailed control. Use positive prompts to guide the AI toward desired styles and features, and negative prompts to filter out unwanted elements or distortions.

Style It with a Reference: Customization Using IP Adapter

If you struggle to find the exact style you want or find prompting difficult, AI Render supports reference-based generation with the use of IP Adapters. This feature lets you upload an image, and the AI will follow its style, lighting, and tone — delivering consistent visual results without the need for perfect prompt wording. 

Beyond Pixel Control: Precision with 3D-Generated ControlNet

ControlNet guides AI generation using structural inputs in addition to prompts. With AI Render, these inputs are generated directly from your 3D environment in iClone and Character Creator, including characters, scene layout, camera framing, and lighting. This delivers accurate, frame-by-frame guidance the AI can follow, without relying on error-prone 2D estimations.

With a massive asset library in the Reallusion ecosystem — featuring drag-and-drop characters, motions, props, and environments — all easily searchable with Deep Search directly in the software, it’s quick and effortless to build a strong foundation for generating high-quality ControlNet inputs.

ControlNet Modes Supported in AI Render

Depth — Spatial layering and facial accuracy

Depth maps from 3D data ensure stable shot distance and accurate layering across frames. Unlike 2D-estimated maps, 3D depth can be manually adjusted for close-ups or wide shots, maintaining correct focus and detail — essential for consistent facial expression control at any distance.

Pose — Reliable skeletal tracking, even with occlusion

2D OpenPose often fails when faces or limbs are obscured or off-frame. 3D OpenPose maintains accurate skeletal tracking throughout, even in complex scenes with multiple interacting characters, ensuring precise timing and body alignment from frame to frame.

Normal — Surface lighting and shading

3D normals offer smooth surface angles for stable lighting and consistent shading. Combined with iClone and Character Creator’s lighting tools, you get clean forms, cinematic highlights, and professional visual quality every frame.

Edge (Canny) — Clean outlines for stylized renders

3D-generated canny edges produce clean, geometry-based outlines — perfect for stylized renders like anime, ink, or line art. When paired with 3D depth, they provide strong compositional control for layered characters and environments.

Prompt: Oil Painting,Bearly,masterpiece, best quality, cyberpunk alley, glowing neon signs, wet floor, vending machines, old pipes, rusty walls, robot citizens, futuristic graffiti, orange and teal lighting, cinematic atmosphere, high detail
Multi-Inputs + Camera Control

You can combine multiple ControlNet inputs for stronger character and scene control. Each input is adjustable via threshold sliders, giving you precision over structure, influence, and visual style.

Pair this with iClone’s powerful camera tools — including lens control, framing, and automated paths — to shape your AI compositions with cinematic perspective and storytelling precision.

Create, Own, and Scale: Build Your Own IP and LoRAs

With Character Creator and iClone, you can create fully rigged, original characters ready for games, animation, virtual production, merchandise, and more. These are professional assets you own and can use across all industries.

Now, with AI Render, your original characters can easily step into AI-powered storytelling to star in AI-generated movies, commercials, and creative projects. By bringing your 3D characters into the ComfyUI workflow, AI Render enables fast, stylized video generation that maintains consistency and gives you full creative control.

Your characters don’t just look good — they behave with the consistency, emotion, and presence of a real person, making them ready for any story you want to tell.

To achieve this high-quality, consistent result in AI generation, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) training is essential. LoRAs are lightweight AI models that preserve your character’s unique look and style across frames, scenes, and creative variations. 

With batch rendering, pose libraries, and automated camera paths in iClone, you can quickly build LoRA training datasets from multiple angles and motions.

Whether you’re creating one character or an entire IP universe, Character Creator, iClone, and AI Render provide a creator-owned pipeline.
